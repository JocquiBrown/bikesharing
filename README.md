# bikesharing

## Project Overview
In this project we worked with the Colorado Board of Elections to complete the following tasks regarding election audit results from a recent election:
In this project we used Citi Bike bikesharing data from New York in order to convince stakeholders to support a bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. To convince stakeholders we created visualizations in Tableau showing a number of patterns and observations.

- The image above shows us that most Citi Bike Users are subscribers, in fact subscribers make up over 75% of the customer base, while pay-per-use customers make up the remainder.

- Next we have the Top Starting Locations for Citi Bike trips in New York, Larger and darker circles represent more trips. In New York City an overwhelming majority of trips start in Manhattan, a prominent area in the city for tourism.

- Here we have a line graph that displays bike checkout times for users throughout the day. Based on the data, we can conclude that bike checkouts increase rapidly in the early morning hours, and then decline slowly throughout the day, while trip durations are also longer in the morning. Longer journeys make up a smaller share of trips taken as the day goes on.

- This line graph breaks down the previous line graph into 3 distinct lines by gender. The orange line represents male bike riders. This line is almost identical to the line representing all users in the previous graph. Checkouts rise until mid-morning, after which they begin to fall along with trip durations as the day progresses. The same trend can be found with female riders, but to a much small degree. The unknown gender graph line, in red, does not appear to show any major trends with bike checkout times.

- This image shows a heat map of the number of trips that occur on each day of the week by hour. Most trips occur during the weekdays around morning and afternoon rush hours. A significant portion of trips also occur over the weekend in the afternoons.

- In this heat map we breakdown the number of trips by gender. Here we see that men and women show the same trip patterns, but we can clearly see that men are taking more trips as a whole. As for unknown gender riders, they're mostly choosing to ride on weekend afternoons and still represent the smallest group of riders by gender.

- The final visualization breaks down User Trips, for both user types, by gender for each day of the week. This heat map shows us that pay-per-use customers prefer to bike on weekends, while subscribers use the service in larger numbers on weekdays. It's also interesting to note that fewer trips occur on Wednesdays when compared to other weekdays.

## Summary
- The key takeaways from our observations conclude that:
  * Most people prefer to subscribe to the City Bike share service
  * Most bikeshare users are male
  * Bike checkouts and trip durations tend to increase rapidly in the morning and decrease later in the day
  * Most bikeshare users are choosing to take trips during morning and evening rush hours on weekdays and during the afternoon on weekends
  * Most bikeshare users take trips in the central business districts and high tourism areas

- For further analysis the following visualizations should be considered using the data from our trip data file:
  * A graph that breaks down customer base by age and gender. This visualization will make it easier to see what demogrpahics are more likely to subscribe vs. pay-per-use. From their we can then compare the demographics of Des Moines to New York City.
  * A graph that shows trip duration by usertype. That way we can see which Citi Bike user takes longer trips. This could affect the number of miles a bike travels per trip and could also determine how often maintenance is needed.
